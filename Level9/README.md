1. In this ponzi scheme contract, you pay more than existing prize to the fallback function (receive) to become new king of the contract and your payment becomes the new prize to beat.
2. Your payment also sends the amount you have paid to the current king. You will make money if next buyer sends more money than you to the contract and become king. 
3. This chain can be broken if you can stop receiving payments to you. If you can do this, even if others pay more than the prize,they cannot become king.
4. We can create a solution contract, that sends ether to king contract and become king. But, refuse to accept payment when others send more prize than you.
5. Irrespective of what any resource say, don't use send and transfer methods to send ether.
